    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees\n",
    "1. Decision trees can be used to detect Fraudulent Financial Statements (FFS). Detection of FFS is a meaningful topic because FFS may reduce government's tax income. Previously, it's difficult to detect FFS due to complex relationships between a large number of variables in a financial statement. According to Decision Tree Applications for Data Modeling, researchers used decision trees to achieve an accuracy of 92% in correctly identifying fraud cases [1].\n",
    "2. The followings are the advantages of using decision trees: 1. When we use decision trees, the algorithm automatically performs feature selections. It selects the best performing features from our feature set when splitting nodes. 2. Decision trees' results are easy to understand and visualize. 3. Decision trees will work without normalizing data. Moreover, they are also not sensitive to outliers since the process of splitting looks at the proportion of data [2]. Decision trees perform well when predicting categorical values like blue, yellow, purple, etc. and continuous values like 2.1, 3.2, etc. [4].\n",
    "3. The following are the disadvantages of using decision trees: 1. Decision trees may create an overly complicated model and caused overfitting. 2. Decision trees may be unstable when there are small variations in the data.    Unstable means different decision trees may be built when those variations exist in the data.  Boosting or bagging may help with this problem [3]. If decision trees overfit, they may perform poorly [5]. Moreover, if we have many classes or small training set, decision trees may perform poorly [6].\n",
    "4. Decision trees may be a good candidate for this problem because they generally do well when predicting categorical values, in this case, 0 or 1, and we have a considerable amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "K-nearest neighbor (KNN)\n",
    "1. A real-world application of KNN would be recommender systems. For instance, if a user likes a particular item and a different user likes that item as well, the things the second user likes may be of interest to the first user. Therefore, we'd like to recommend those items to the first user [6].\n",
    "2. The followings are the strengths of KNN: 1. It's robust to noisy training data. 2. Performs well if we have an extensive training data [7].\n",
    "3. The weaknesses of KNN are the following: 1. Need to determine a number for how many neighbors we're grouping. 2.Has to decide which distance metric to use. 3. It's computationally intensive since we need to compute the distances of each point to other points in training [7]. KNN's performance could suffer when the data are in high dimensional space because distance for all data points is very similar. It becomes meaningless to use distance as a metric for grouping neighbors [9].\n",
    "4. KNN may be a good candidate for this problem because we have a considerable amount of data, and it has been shown to outperform decision tree and Naive Bayes in some situations [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "1. A real-world application of ensemble methods would be the Netflix Challenge, a competition to come up with a new recommender system for Netflix, where the winning team wins the challenge by using an ensemble of models [8].\n",
    "2. The followings are the strengths of ensemble methods: 1. They are more tolerant of biases and variance in the data. 2. They're less likely to overfit [10].\n",
    "3.  The followings are the weaknesses of ensemble methods: 1. Ensemble methods, in particular, AdaBoost, perform poorly in predicting probability estimates. 2. For reasoning about data, it's better to use a graphical model, which is easier to understand [11].\n",
    "4. Ensemble methods may be a good candidate for this problem because we're predicting whether or not a person earns more or less than $50,000, which seems to be a suitable type of problem for ensemble methods. \n",

    "I used Decision Trees, KNN, and AdaBoost with the default base estimator, DecisionTree, for predicting whether or not a person earns more than $50,000. In terms of the training and predicting time, AdaBoost takes the longest followed by KNN and the Decision Tree Classifier. AdaBoost's training and predicting time seems logical in that the default estimators is 50, so it creates 50 decision trees (the weak learners) to build a final strong learner for prediction. As for the F-score, Adaboost does not perform as well as other classifiers in the training set, but it delivers the best score in the testing set. It does not seem to suffer from overfitting (high f-score in training set and low f-score in testing set) or underfitting  (low f-score in both training set and testing set). We could, however, tune its hyper-parameters to achieve better results. AdaBoost seems to be the best algorithm for this problem compared to Decision Trees and KNN. With the default hyper-parameters, Decision Tree Classifier appears to suffer from overfitting.  KNN does not seem to suffer from overfitting, but it doesn't perform as well as AdaBoost."

    "Our dataset's labels are 1 (>= 50K) and 0 (< 50K). Initially, our data points have the same weight. The first decision tree tries to make the best decision to classify those points. Those misclassified points will have weights more than the other correctly classified points. The second decision tree will take those weights into account and try to classify those misclassified points from the first decision tree correctly. This process will continue until perfect fit, or it has run a \"n_estimators\" number of times. As for predictions, AdaBoost will run those n classifiers one by one on the testing set and get a prediction (1 or 0) for each classifier. Moreover, based on the majority vote, if the number of 1s is greater than the number of 0s, we will make the final prediction of 1. However, if the number of 1s is smaller than the number of 0s, we will make the final prediction of 0 [2].\n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "I got age, capital-gain, and hours-per-week in my top 5, but I did not get education-num and capital-loss. I did not include education-num because I thought a person's occupation would be a stronger indicator than education-level or education-num. Nevertheless, education-num could decide what kinds of jobs a person is likely to take, which in turn makes a better indicator than occupation. Capital-loss could be a good indicator for the same reason as capital-gain, which means a person with capital-loss or capital-gain has more assets and is more likely to sell them."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
